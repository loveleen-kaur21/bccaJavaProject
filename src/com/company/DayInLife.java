                A normal day in the life of a base camp student looks pretty different based on where you are
                during the year. Say if you are at the beginning of the year. You are pretty new at Base Camp
                so you are supervised more. Every day will start off with a Community and Professional block
                with Fernae. In here, you will do exercises to get to know each other more and common exercises
                to start the exercise of practicing professionalism. Then you will have a technical block with Nate,
                where you will work on anything assigned. Throughout the day, you will be alternating between breaks,
                Community and Professional, and technical blocks. Now, if you are past the 10 weeks mark, you will start
                to feel a little less supervised. The staff will allow more freedom to you where you can take breaks whenever
                needed and work is split up into four blocks.
