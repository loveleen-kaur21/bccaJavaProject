                Through the course of the year, work at Base Camp will be very self-paced. A student may catch the first
                module of a unit easier than another. However, the next unit may be the opposite for those 2 
                students. Self-pacing will ensure that students are able to study content on their own pace. The Base Camp 
                Coding Academy Technical Curriculum is broken down into nine units. Each unit consumes five weeks of class 
                time and produces a product for the studentâ€™s technical portfolio. With the exception of the final unit, 
                four weeks of each unit are dedicated to new content with the fifth week going to a final project for the unit. 
                The final unit is entirely dedicated to development of a capstone project. By the end of the curriculum, 
                students have a portfolio of nine projects (one being the portfolio itself) to demonstrate their ability as a 
                web developer.
